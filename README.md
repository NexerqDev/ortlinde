"Simple SDVX Konasute Launcher"

Simple, as in simple on the code side. Doesn't try to deal with complicated auth, multiple games, UI, etc. Instead just prompts for your cookie from the official site if expired.

For a more fleshed-out one, https://github.com/anon5r/KsGameLauncher might be better (note, not an endorsement from me. I haven't ever even downloaded it.).

I built this for myself to have a quick double click in to the game and easily auditable source code :)

Windows x64 CI builds can be found at https://github.com/NexerqDev/ortlinde/actions (pick latest one and grab the exe in artifacts)
